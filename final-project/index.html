                        On Instagram feeds, martini glasses clink in what feels like a never-ending loop. Photo
                        carousels from nights out show low-lit steakhouses, tartare and soufflés, Luxardo cherries.
                        (What, in this economy, is screaming Luxardo cherries?) A roommate’s random co-worker is somehow
                        lounging on yet another cabana in yet another tropical bathing suit. (Who owns that many bathing
                        suits?) A co-worker’s random roommate is inexplicably trying out a new Bitcoin-powered
                        bathhouse.

                        Just one click away is the news: flip-flopping on tariffs that could hit iPhones, T-shirts,
                        backpacks and toothbrushes. There are wildly zigzagging red lines on market charts and somber
                        television newscasters with panicked voices talking about retirement savings, which is
                        angst-inducing even for people decades away from retirement.

                        “Phone-eats-first type of food, whatever viral sweater is going around on TikTok, the new work
                        bag,” said Devin Walsh, 25, who lives in New York and works in marketing, listing the tempting
                        purchases that flit across her Instagram, even, stubbornly, this past week. “Meanwhile, everyone
                        is referencing the Great Depression.”

                        It’s a dizzying time to be a 20-something inundated by social media feeds flashing other
                        people’s trips and restaurant reservations, which feel more over-the-top than ever, thanks to
                        what trend forecasters call the “boom boom aesthetic.” It’s a recent embrace, by fashion labels,
                        influencers and ordinary spenders, of lavish old-money consumption, like Gordon Gekko-inspired
                        suits and endless (once verboten) furs.

                        Many young people are plagued by pangs of economic self-doubt, telling friends or therapists
                        that they can’t keep up with the Joneses (and what the Joneses are posting on Instagram). Others
                        are struggling to save, and then making impulse buys that leave them feeling anxious or guilty,
